Now this requires nothing more than adding a class...with patches

You can make everything-

- Squares
- Rhombuses
- Triangles
- Pentagon
- Hexagon
- Heptagon
- Octagon
- Nonagon
- Decagon
- Circles
- Stars

...and much _more_

### With nice looking animations ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

#### And also 'cause I know writing CSS is ðŸ˜´

This is the true essence of **PATCHES**.
