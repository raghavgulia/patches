Now this requires nothing more than adding a class...with patches

You can make everything-

- Squares

- Triangles
- Pentagon
- Hexagon
- Heptagon
- Octagon
- Nonagon
- Decagon
- Circles
- Stars

...and much _more_

### With nice looking animations ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ

This is the true essence of **PATCHES**.

### Create a _waffle_ ðŸ¥ªðŸ˜‹

> First note it is not only to create goodies. It was created to make **_WONDERFUL_** grid designs with cool animations

#### Step 1: Create a HTML file

#### Step 2: Download and link the CSS file you can find [HERE](https://github.com/raghavgulia/patches/blob/main/style.css)

#### Step 3: In your HTML, type the following code(make sure you use emmet)

```html
<div class="grid"></div>
```

Inside it, write the emmet code

```html
(.squares)*64
```

Now you'll have a square grid like this
